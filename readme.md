🚀 I currently work on/at my company 🔥 [Torch Ventures](https://torch.ventures), which is an attempt at entrepreneurial praxis. In other words, I'm broke, I need your money and I'm selling things that you'll totally buy 😂. I've managed to find some interesting products and services that have been useful to me (see the content below). If you also found them valuable, please don't hesitate to explore their ventures. I'm sure they can use a "thanks" for their efforts. As for Torch, I'm gathering all of these resources and providing streamlined service packages and quality products for purchase. Let me know if you're interested or if you'd like to collaborate!
